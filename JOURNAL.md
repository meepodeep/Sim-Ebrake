This is my journal of the design and building process of **Sim Ebrake**.

## 10/9/2025 8 PM - Started the 3d model and part sourcing

So far, I have decided what parts I will be using for the mechanisms, bearings, rods, etc. And started work on the actual model for the project! The electronics of the ebrake will be a Hall effect sensor with a promicro to read the values and send them to the pc. (still working on implementing those into the model)  

## 10/9/2025 9 PM - Added the electronics and springs to the model in fusion

I added the Pro Micro, hall effect sensor, magnet, and spring. I also modeled the side of the chassis. I also decided to use the university laser to cut acrylic windows into the side panels of the case. Adding materials to the model really makes it pop

## 10/10/2025 - DOCS and CHASSIS  

Today I did a lot of documentation, and I also edited the chassis. Here is a pic from the readme. I added step-by-step instructions with pictures on how to build the ebrake! ![image.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MTQ2OCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--528a8e544d26ad5dcf5d0fc1bc4c14451d5e3263/image.png)
Along with the readme I also made my BOM today, heres that in sheets.![image.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MTQ2OSwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--6bf0fae586b937d147b6a5689bf713fe5e643f7f/image.png)
But the most interesting part of what I did was add moza handbrake mounting holes and changed the chassis design!
