## 10/9/2025 - Started the 3d model and part sourcing

So far, I have decided what parts I will be using for the mechanisms, bearings, rods, etc. And started work on the actual model for the project! The electronics of the ebrake will be a Hall effect sensor with a promicro to read the values and send them to the pc. (still working on implementing those into the model)
